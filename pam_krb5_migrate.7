.SH SYNOPSIS
auth            optional	pam_krb5_migrate.so
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR pam_krb5_migrate 
is a stackable authentication module that takes a username
and password from an earlier module in the stack, and attempts to
transparently add them to a Kerberos realm using the Kerberos 5 kadmin
service.

The module can be used to ease the administrative burdens of migrating
a large installed userbase from pre-existing authentication methods to a
Kerberos-based setup.
