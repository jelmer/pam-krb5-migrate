Package: libpam-krb5-migrate-heimdal
Architecture: any
Depends: libpam-runtime (>= 1.0.1-6), ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: PAM module for migrating to Heimdal Kerberos
 A stackable authentication module that takes a username and password from an
 earlier module in the stack and attempts to transparently add the user to a
 Kerberos realm using the Kerberos 5 kadmin service. The module can be used to
 ease the administrative burdens of migrating a large installed userbase from
 pre-existing authentication methods to a Kerberos-based setup.
 .
 This package allows updating the database of a remote Heimdal server.
