Description: PAM modules for migrating to Kerberos
 A stackable authentication module that takes a username and password from an 
 earlier module in the stack and attempts to transparently add the user to a 
 Kerberos realm using the Kerberos 5 kadmin service. The module can be used to 
 ease the administrative burdens of migrating a large installed userbase from 
 pre-existing authentication methods to a Kerberos-based setup.
