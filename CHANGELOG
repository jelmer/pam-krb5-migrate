version 0.0.3  11 Sep 2001
   - make sure we use the DEFAULT_KEYTAB define, since we have it available.
   - add support for min_uid option, submitted by Gordon Tetlow
     <gordont@gnf.org>

version 0.0.2  26 Apr 2001
   - fix bug in cleanup handling; now that we're passing in the right
     kind of void pointer, we shouldn't be leaving temp files around
     any more.
   - fixed typo to the default principal name in the INSTALL file.
